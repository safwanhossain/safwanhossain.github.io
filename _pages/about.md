I am currently a PhD student at Harvard, working in the [EconCS](https://econcs.seas.harvard.edu/) group with [Yiling Chen](https://yiling.seas.harvard.edu/). My research interests are broadly at the intersection of economics and computer science. Specifically, I am interested in questions related to strategic behaviour and incentives that arise in supervised or online multi-agent learning problems. A line of my work relates to computational problems in information design. 

Prior to my PhD, I was a machine learning engineer at [Cerebras Systems](https://www.cerebras.net/), where I built machine learning frameworks for running very large models on our custom accelerator. I completed my Master's degree in computer science at the [University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu) where I was supervised by [Nisarg Shah](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nisarg/), and my bachelors degree in electrical and computer engineering from the same institution. In my free time, I love to run and bike, read classic literature, and cook.
