I am currently a PhD student at Harvard, working in the [EconCS](https://econcs.seas.harvard.edu/) group with [Yiling Chen](https://yiling.seas.harvard.edu/). Prior to this, I was a machine learning engineer at Cerebras Systems, where I built Tensorflow support for running very large models on our custom accelerator. I completed my Master's degree in computer science at the [University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu) where I was supervised by [Nisarg Shah](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nisarg/), and my bachelors degree in electrical and computer engineering from the same institution.

My research interests are broadly at the intersection of economics and computer science. Specifically, I am interested in questions related to strategic behaviour, fairness, and incentives that arise in supervised or online learning settings with multiple agents. Recently, I have also been working on computational problems in information design. I am always happy to chat about these topics or EconCS in general!

In my free time, I love running and biking around Boston and Toronto, the two cities where I spend most of my time. I also love hiking and have visited 14 national parks across the US and Canada. Beyond that, I also enjoy reading classic literature, cooking, photography, and gardening.
