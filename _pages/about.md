I am a graduate student in computer science at the [University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu) and [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). 
I am grateful to be supervised by [Nisarg Shah](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nisarg/) \(CS Theory group\) and [Frank Rudzicz](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~frank/) \(Vector Institute\). 
My research explores stratgic behaviour, fairness, and incentives in machine learning, and using techniques from algorithmic game theory, economics and mechanism design. 
As secondary interests, I have also delved into generative modelling and neural ODEs. 
Prior to graduate school, I completed my bachelors degree in electrical and computer engineering at the University to Toronto.
