I am a graduate student in computer science at the University of Toronto and Vector Institute. I am grateful to be supervised by Dr. Nisarg Shah (CS Theory group) and Dr. Frank Rudzicz (Vector Institute). My research explores stratgic behaviour, fairness, and incentives in machine learning, and using techniques from algorithmic game theory, economics and mechanism design. As secondary interests, I have also delved into generative modelling and neural ODEs. Prior to graduate school, I completed by bachelors degree in electrical and computer engineering at the University to Toronto.
