* **BSc Electrical and Computer Engineering**, University of Toronto, 2018

Work experience
======
* **Summer 2018**: Research Intern at [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/)
    * Worked with Dr. Frank Rudzicz on an NLP project investigating text generation using GANs by interpreting them as word vectors. Attempted to incorporate grammatical information to aid generation. Investigated various metrics to judge quality of the samples including BLEU scores and perplexity.
