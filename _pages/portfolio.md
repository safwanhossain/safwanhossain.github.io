Education
======
* **PhD Computer Science**, Harvard University, 
* **MSc Computer Science**, University of Toronto, 2020 
* **BSc Electrical and Computer Engineering**, University of Toronto, 2018

Work experience
======
* **June 2020 - June 2022**: Machine Learning Engineer at [Cerebras Systems](https://www.cerebras.net/)
    * I currently work as a machine learning engineer at Cerebras Systems, a late stage start-up building a new class of computers for deep learning workloads. I am part of various endeavours here, including building a custom Tensorflow XLA backend for our hardware, developing a new distributed training approach to efficiently run large models, and exploring state-of-the-art sparse training algorithms.
* **Summer 2018**: Research Intern at [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/)
    * Worked with [Dr. Frank Rudzicz](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~frank/) on an NLP project investigating text generation using GANs by interpreting them as word vectors. Attempted to incorporate grammatical information to aid generation. Investigated various metrics to judge quality of the samples, including BLEU scores and perplexity.
* **May 2016 - June 2017**: Compiler Engineer Intern at [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/programmable.html)
    * Year long internship in Intel's FPGA compiler team. Worked on optimizing routing algorithms to reduce clock skew. Modelled clock placement as a constraint satisfaction problem that resulted in 1.5% increase in the maximum operating frequency of the latest Intel FPGA chips. 
* **Summer 2015**: Software Engineering Intern at [Arista Networks](https://www.arista.com/en/)
    * Worked in the software defined networking team. Created an API to program against VSphere, VMware's cloud platform, to enable easy testing and deployment of cloud networking solutions.
